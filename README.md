# üìö Skill System Stack

This repo defines a **5-part system** for teaching, practicing, and verifying skills in a consistent way.
Each document plays a distinct role but links with the others to create an end-to-end flow ‚Äî from defining skills, to preparing learners, to verifying them in a reproducible lab environment.

## 1. üß© Skill Framework

**Purpose:** Defines _what_ learners should know and do.

- Progressive levels: Exploring ‚Üí Applying ‚Üí Building ‚Üí Advancing ‚Üí Innovating
- Skills written with Bloom‚Äôs verbs, 7‚Äì13 per level
- Professional/enterprise focus

**Feeds into:**

- Skill Verifier (defines how to measure each skill)
- Practice Questions (recall checks)
- Lab Environment (fixtures for hands-on practice)
- Prep Guide (chooses prep exercises aligned to level)

---

## 2. üîé Skill Verifier

**Purpose:** Defines _how_ to measure skills.

- Maps skills to verification methods (auto, manual, practice question, lab)
- Lists probes (commands, file checks, dataset queries)
- Documents pass/fail criteria
- Notes reset/reproducibility conditions

**Feeds into:**

- Lab Environment (fixtures to prepare for verification)
- Prep Guide (designs practice drills, distinct from verification probes)

---

## 3. üìù Practice Questions

**Purpose:** Provides **reusable practice questions** for warm-ups and formative checks.

- Question types: multiple choice, true/false, short answer
- Each question tied directly to a skill in the Skill Framework
- Includes correct answers, distractors, and hints
- Used primarily in prep sessions, not in the official Skill Verifier set

**Feeds into:**

- Prep Guide (for warm-up and formative questions that differ from verification items)
- Skill Verifier (can inspire verification questions, but should not be reused verbatim)

---

## 4. üß™ Lab Environment

**Purpose:** Provides a **sandbox** for skill practice and verification.

- Defines fixtures: repos, datasets, configs
- Provides scripts (`bootstrap.sh`, `reset.sh`, `verify.sh`)
- Orchestrates with `Makefile`
- Packages into a distributable ZIP

**Feeds into:**

- Skill Verifier (fixtures for auto-verification)
- Prep Guide (practice activities inside the same environment, with variations)

---

## 5. üë©‚Äçüè´ Prep Guide

**Purpose:** Guides learners in **preparing for verification**.

- Makes initial level assessment (background + varied Practice Questions)
- Places learner into a skill level band (Exploring ‚Üí Innovating)
- Assigns **distinct prep exercises** (different from verification, but aligned)
- Uses **Lab Environment** with small variations
- Encourages reflection and self-assessment

**Feeds from:**

- Skill Framework (skills to target)
- Skill Verifier (areas to prepare, without reusing probes)
- Practice Questions (sample items, re-worded for practice)
- Lab Environment (sandbox for prep labs)

---

# üîÑ How They Fit Together

1. **Skill Framework** = the map of skills
2. **Skill Verifier** = the measuring system
3. **Practice Questions** = the quiz bank for warm-ups
4. **Lab Environment** = the sandbox
5. **Prep Guide** = the practice coach

üëâ Learner flow:

- Prep Guide starts with warm-up questions (Practice Questions) + background
- Places learner on Skill Framework level
- Recommends prep exercises (distinct from verification, but in Lab Environment)
- When ready ‚Üí learner takes verification using Skill Verifier in Lab Environment

---

## Skill Framework

```
**Topic:** {{metadata.display_topic}}

**Goal:** Create a structured skill framework for the topic that is:

- Organized into **five progressive levels**: Exploring, Applying, Building, Advancing, Innovating.
- Uses **Bloom‚Äôs Taxonomy verbs** appropriate for each level.
- Includes **7‚Äì13 skills per level** (except Innovating).
- Skips overly **niche/rare skills** ‚Äî focus on broadly useful, practical competencies.
- Written for a **professional/enterprise context**.


FORMAT ALL RESULTS AS MARKDOWN.

---

### Level 1 ‚Äì Exploring

_Focus: learn the basics and build foundational understanding._

- Use verbs like **Identify, Define, Describe, Recognize, Recall, List, Explain.**
- Skills should involve **introductory concepts, definitions, and recognition tasks.**

### Level 2 ‚Äì Applying

_Focus: use foundational knowledge in real scenarios with guidance._

- Use verbs like **Apply, Demonstrate, Execute, Use, Implement, Perform, Illustrate.**
- Skills should show the learner can **perform tasks with guidance or in familiar contexts.**

### Level 3 ‚Äì Building

_Focus: deliver projects independently and solve real problems._

- Use verbs like **Develop, Construct, Organize, Design, Produce, Solve, Modify, Present.**
- Skills should represent **autonomy in task execution and integration of concepts.**

### Level 4 ‚Äì Advancing

_Focus: optimize, integrate, and analyze in complex environments._

- Use verbs like **Analyze, Evaluate, Optimize, Integrate, Compare, Critique, Adapt, Lead.**
- Skills should capture **advanced efficiency, integration, and leadership.**

### Level 5 ‚Äì Innovating

_Focus: establish best practices, create new solutions, and mentor others._

- Use verbs like **Invent, Create, Formulate, Innovate, Mentor, Establish, Define Standards, Propose, Lead Development.**
- Skills should reflect **thought leadership, innovation, and mentoring.**
- 5‚Äì10 skills are sufficient.

---

## üìå Fully Fleshed-Out Example (Regex, Level 1)

**Topic:** Regular Expressions

**Level 1 ‚Äì Exploring**

- Identify what regular expressions are and their role in text search and manipulation.
- Describe the difference between literal characters and metacharacters.
- Recognize common regex metacharacters: `.`, `*`, `+`, `?`.
- List character classes such as `[a-z]`, `\d`, `\w`, and `\s`.
- Explain the purpose of anchors: `^` (start of string), `$` (end of string).
- Recall the concept of grouping with parentheses `()`.
- Recognize alternation with the `|` operator.
- Describe the difference between greedy and lazy quantifiers.
- Identify typical use cases: searching logs, validating simple strings, filtering text in CLI tools like `grep`.

üëâ This shows the expected **detail, granularity, and phrasing**. Other levels should match this level of depth.

---

## Verification Notes (Optional)

The current MCP toolset typically supports:

- Running **shell commands** (e.g., `git`, `sqlite3`, `jq`, `ls`).
- Reading, writing, and editing **files**.
- Inspecting **directory trees** and file metadata.

Implications:

- **Level 1‚Äì3 skills** are usually verifiable (state changes, query outputs, file contents).
- **Level 4 skills** are often verifiable, but may need setup (bisect logs, EXPLAIN plans, hook scripts).
- **Level 5 skills** are generally reflective (team standards, mentoring) and not auto-checkable.

```

## Skill Verifier

````
# üîé Skill Verifier

The Skill Verifier connects the **Skill Framework** (what to learn) with the **MCP toolset** (what can be programmatically checked).

---

## Purpose

- Identify which skills are auto-verifiable, which require scaffolding, which suit knowledge checks, and which require manual review
- Define the fixtures (repos, datasets, files) needed for each skill
- Suggest probes (commands, queries, inspections)
- Establish pass/fail criteria and reset conditions
- Ensure results are consistent with a standard schema

```

## Lab Environment

```

# üß™ Lab Environment Blueprint (LEB)

The Lab Environment Blueprint defines the **practical environment** that learners interact with when working on skills in the framework.
It translates requirements from the **Verification Capability Map (VCM)** into concrete setup instructions (fixtures, datasets, repos, scripts).

Its purpose is to:

- Document the **fixtures** required (repositories, datasets, configuration files).
- Specify the **bootstrap process** for creating the lab environment.
- Define how the environment can be **reset/cleaned** between attempts.
- Keep labs **lightweight and reproducible** (size and runtime constraints).
- Ensure verifiers have a known starting point to run probes consistently.
- **Generate runnable scripts (`bootstrap.sh`, `reset.sh`, `verify.sh`) and a `Makefile`.**
- **Bundle everything into a downloadable ZIP with a README.md.**

Run with:

```bash
make verify
```

---

## üîí Safety

All repos and files are **local and sandboxed**.
No external network calls are made (remotes are simulated with local bare repos).

---

## üôã Help

```bash
make help
```

```

---

## Example Lab Environment (Git)

- **Fixture:** Repo with `main` and `feature` branches, 5 commits each.
- **Bootstrap:** `git init`, add commits programmatically.
- **Reset:** Remove repo directory and recreate from seed script.
- **Verify:** Run `git log`, `git branch` to confirm seeded state.
- **Size:** < 1 MB, runtime < 10s.
- **Orchestration:** Use `make up`, `make verify`, `make reset`.
- **Packaging:** Deliver as `git-lab-starter.zip`.

---

## Purpose

- Make an initial assessment of learner level
- Guide toward the right skills from the Skill Framework
- Provide practice exercises that differ in surface form from verification
- Build familiarity with the Lab Environment
- Encourage reflection and self-assessment

---

## Skill Framework Link

{{skill_framework}}

---

## MCP Context

Here are some of the MCP tools available. Consider how you would use them when making your response:

{{mcp_context}}

---

## 1. Assessment Phase

- Background questions: learner‚Äôs experience, frequency of use, recency
- Knowledge Bank warm-ups: varied phrasings
- Scenario probe: ‚ÄúImagine you needed to ‚Ä¶ what steps would you take?‚Äù
- Outcome: learner placed in a tentative level band

---

## 2. Prep Strategy by Level

- **Exploring / Applying:** core concepts, guided walkthroughs, compare outputs
- **Building / Advancing:** scenario drills, modified probes, predict outcomes before running
- **Innovating:** mentor others, propose workflows, critique processes

---

## 3. Design Rules

- Do **not** reuse Skill Verifier probes
- Cover the same skills, but with different surface tasks
- Use Lab Environment fixtures with variations (filenames, branch names, data)
- End with reflection prompts: ‚ÄúWhat did you learn? What feels uncertain?‚Äù

---

## 4. Instructor Flow

1. Background + warm-ups
2. Place learner at a level
3. Select prep path
4. Run varied practice in Lab Environment
5. Reflection + confidence check
6. Next steps (reading, peer discussion, reset lab)

```
