# ‚ö° Lite Skill Framework Template (80/20 Practitioner Focus)

**Topic:** Regular Expressions with Bash

**Goal:** Create a structured skill framework for the topic that is:

* Organized into **three progressive levels**: Beginner, Intermediate, Strong-Intermediate.
* Uses **Bloom‚Äôs Taxonomy verbs** appropriate for each level.
* Focused on the **20% of features that cover 80% of real-world usage**.
* Skips niche/rare features ‚Äî optimized for **practitioner fluency in everyday contexts**.
* Written for a **professional/enterprise context**.

FORMAT ALL RESULTS AS MARKDOWN.

---

### Level 1 ‚Äì Beginner

*Focus: understand the essentials and build a working foundation.*

* Use verbs like **Identify, Define, Recognize, Recall, Describe, Execute.**
* Skills should involve **core vocabulary, mental models, and execution of the most common tasks**.
* Learners at this level can perform **basic workflows** and explain **what the tool/feature is for**.

---

### Level 2 ‚Äì Intermediate

*Focus: apply the core features in realistic scenarios and solve common problems independently.*

* Use verbs like **Apply, Demonstrate, Modify, Use, Implement, Combine.**
* Skills should show the learner can **connect multiple features together**, handle **typical errors**, and work **without much guidance**.
* Learners at this level can complete **80% of practical, day-to-day use cases**.

---

### Level 3 ‚Äì Strong-Intermediate

*Focus: extend, adapt, and streamline workflows for reliability and efficiency.*

* Use verbs like **Adapt, Troubleshoot, Refine, Optimize, Configure, Evaluate.**
* Skills should involve **troubleshooting, cleanup, and efficiency improvements**, but not drift into rare or ‚Äúexpert‚Äù territory.
* Learners at this level are **fluent practitioners**: they know when to apply or avoid features, how to adapt them to team contexts, and how to keep workflows smooth.

## üìå Example (Topic: SQL Joins)

**Level 1 ‚Äì Beginner**

* Identify what a JOIN is and why it‚Äôs used.
* Recognize the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN.
* Execute a simple INNER JOIN between two tables.
* Recall the concept of primary/foreign keys in JOINs.

**Level 2 ‚Äì Intermediate**

* Apply LEFT JOINs to include unmatched rows.
* Demonstrate combining multiple JOINs in a single query.
* Modify queries to troubleshoot missing rows.
* Use table aliases to simplify JOIN syntax.
* Implement JOINs with basic filtering (`WHERE`).

**Level 3 ‚Äì Strong-Intermediate**

* Adapt queries with different JOIN types (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT) depending on the use case.
* Troubleshoot ambiguous column names or NULL issues in JOIN results.
* Refine queries for readability and maintainability.
* Optimize common JOINs using indexes.
* Evaluate when a JOIN is the right tool vs. when to use subqueries or UNION.
