# üß™ Lab Environment Blueprint (LEB)

The Lab Environment Blueprint defines the **practical environment** that learners interact with when working on skills in the framework.
It translates requirements from the **Verification Capability Map (VCM)** into concrete setup instructions (fixtures, datasets, repos, scripts).

Its purpose is to:

* Document the **fixtures** required (repositories, datasets, configuration files).
* Specify the **bootstrap process** for creating the lab environment.
* Define how the environment can be **reset/cleaned** between attempts.
* Keep labs **lightweight and reproducible** (size and runtime constraints).
* Ensure verifiers have a known starting point to run probes consistently.
* **Generate runnable scripts (`bootstrap.sh`, `reset.sh`, `verify.sh`) and a `Makefile`.**
* **Bundle everything into a downloadable ZIP with a README.md.**

### Level 1 ‚Äì Exploring

_Focus: learn the basics and build foundational understanding._

- Identify what Git is and describe its role in version control compared to centralized systems.
- Define core Git concepts: repository, commit, branch, merge, remote.
- Recognize the difference between a working directory, staging area, and commit history.
- List common Git commands and their purposes (`init`, `clone`, `status`, `add`, `commit`).
- Describe the difference between local and remote repositories.
- Explain the purpose of `.gitignore` and how it affects version tracking.
- Recall how to configure user information (`git config`) at local vs. global scope.
- Recognize the structure of a commit (hash, message, author, timestamp).
- Identify typical enterprise use cases: code collaboration, change tracking, auditability.

---

### Level 2 ‚Äì Applying

_Focus: use foundational knowledge in real scenarios with guidance._

- Apply Git commands to create and clone repositories.
- Demonstrate adding, staging, and committing changes.
- Execute branching operations to create and switch between branches.
- Use `git log`, `git diff`, and `git status` to inspect repository history and changes.
- Implement basic merges and recognize merge conflicts.
- Perform pushes and pulls with a remote (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
- Illustrate how to create and manage `.gitignore` for common project types.
- Demonstrate undo operations (`git checkout`, `git reset`, `git revert`) in simple cases.
- Apply tagging for marking releases or milestones.

- Design `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` rules to support team/project needs.
- Use stashing (`git stash`) to manage context switching in active work.
- Implement shallow clones, sparse checkouts, or submodules for large projects.
- Integrate Git hooks for local automation (e.g., linting, pre-commit checks).

---

### Level 4 ‚Äì Advancing

_Focus: optimize, integrate, and analyze in complex environments._

- Analyze commit history to trace bugs or regressions (`git bisect`).
- Evaluate branching strategies (Git Flow, trunk-based, GitHub Flow) for enterprise teams.
- Optimize repository performance (pruning, garbage collection, large file handling).
- Integrate Git with CI/CD systems for automated builds and deployments.
- Adapt workflows to enterprise compliance requirements (signed commits, audit trails).
- Compare and critique different conflict-resolution approaches (merge vs. rebase).
- Lead adoption of code review workflows with pull requests and approvals.
- Integrate Git with external tools (issue trackers, project management systems).
- Adapt submodules, monorepos, or subtrees for complex project structures.
- Evaluate and optimize use of Git LFS (Large File Storage).
- Lead team-wide migration projects (e.g., SVN to Git).

---

### Level 5 ‚Äì Innovating

_Focus: establish best practices, create new solutions, and mentor others._

- Define enterprise Git standards (commit message conventions, branching models).
- Create training and mentoring resources to upskill colleagues in Git.
- Innovate automation solutions with custom hooks and CI/CD pipelines.
- Establish governance for repository structure, permissions, and security.

## ‚ö° Environment Notes

* **OS base image:** Ubuntu 22.04 (recommended)
* **Tools required:** `git` (‚â•2.34), `make`, `bash`
* **Optional tools:** `jq`, `sqlite3` (depending on fixtures)
* **Default workspace:** `./labs` (overridable with `LAB_ROOT=/path make up`)

---

## üßπ Resetting & Cleaning

* `make reset` ‚Üí Full reset (wipes and re-runs bootstrap).
* `make clean` ‚Üí Deletes the labs directory only.
* `make reup` ‚Üí Equivalent to `make clean` + `make up`.

---

## üß™ Verification

The verification script checks:

* Correct branches, commits, and tags exist.
* Repo state matches baseline (no missing fixtures).
* Optional tests run successfully (e.g., `git bisect` finds seeded bug).

Run with:

```bash
make verify
```

---

## üîí Safety

All repos and files are **local and sandboxed**.
No external network calls are made (remotes are simulated with local bare repos).

---

## üôã Help

```bash
make help
```

```

---

## Example Lab Environment (Git)

- **Fixture:** Repo with `main` and `feature` branches, 5 commits each.  
- **Bootstrap:** `git init`, add commits programmatically.  
- **Reset:** Remove repo directory and recreate from seed script.  
- **Verify:** Run `git log`, `git branch` to confirm seeded state.  
- **Size:** < 1 MB, runtime < 10s.  
- **Orchestration:** Use `make up`, `make verify`, `make reset`.  
- **Packaging:** Deliver as `git-lab-starter.zip`.
