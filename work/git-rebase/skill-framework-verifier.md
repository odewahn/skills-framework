# üîé Verification Capability Map (VCM) ‚Äî Git Rebase

The VCM bridges the **Git Rebase Skill Framework** and the **MCP tools** (shell probes, file checks, scaffolding repos).
Level 5 skills are **out of scope** (manual reflection only).

- **Probes:** `git log` confirms C‚Äôs parent is A
- **Pass/Fail:** Correct ancestry

---

### Skill: Execute `git rebase -i` to reorder, squash, edit

- **Feasibility:** verifiable with scaffolding (interactive stdin)
- **Fixtures:** Repo with 3 commits, prompt learner to squash 2 into 1

- **Pass/Fail:** Expected commit count and messages
- **Reset:** true

---

### Skill: Perform conflict resolution during rebase

- **Feasibility:** verifiable with scaffolding
- **Fixtures:** Repo with conflicting changes
- **Probes:** Learner must resolve file, `git add`, then `git rebase --continue`
- **Pass/Fail:** Conflict resolved, rebase completed

---

### Skill: Implement `git rebase --abort` and `--skip`

- **Feasibility:** auto-verifiable with scaffolding
- **Fixtures:** Repo mid-rebase with conflict
- **Probes:** Learner runs `git rebase --abort` ‚Üí confirm branch reset to pre-rebase state
- **Pass/Fail:** History restored

---

### Skill: Illustrate difference between squash vs. fixup

- **Feasibility:** knowledge check (optional lab)
- **Mode:** MCQ
- **Q:** What does `fixup` do compared to `squash`?
  **Correct:** Both combine commits, but `fixup` discards the commit message

---

### Skill: Use `git log --oneline --graph` to verify history
