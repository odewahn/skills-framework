# üß™ Lab Environment Blueprint (LEB)

The Lab Environment Blueprint defines the **practical environment** that learners interact with when working on skills in the framework.
It translates requirements from the **Verification Capability Map (VCM)** into concrete setup instructions (fixtures, datasets, repos, scripts).

Its purpose is to:

* Document the **fixtures** required (repositories, datasets, configuration files).
* Specify the **bootstrap process** for creating the lab environment.
* Define how the environment can be **reset/cleaned** between attempts.
* Keep labs **lightweight and reproducible** (size and runtime constraints).
* Ensure verifiers have a known starting point to run probes consistently.
* **Generate runnable scripts (`bootstrap.sh`, `reset.sh`, `verify.sh`) and a `Makefile`.**
* **Bundle everything into a downloadable ZIP with a README.md.**

# üß© Skill Framework: Regular Expressions with Bash

### Level 1 ‚Äì Exploring

_Focus: learn the basics and build foundational understanding._

- Identify what regular expressions are and their purpose in Bash text processing.
- Define the difference between literal characters and regex metacharacters.
- Recognize common metacharacters: `.`, `*`, `+`, `?`.
- List common shorthand character classes: `\d`, `\w`, `\s`.
- Describe explicit character classes: `[abc]`, `[a-z]`, `[^0-9]`.
- Explain the role of anchors: `^` (start of line), `$` (end of line).
- Recall the syntax for grouping `()`, alternation `|`, and escaping `\`.
- Recognize the difference between basic regex (BRE) and extended regex (ERE).
- Identify typical tools in Bash that support regex: `grep`, `egrep`, `sed`, `awk`.
- Explain the concept of greedy vs. non-greedy quantifiers.

---

### Level 2 ‚Äì Applying

_Focus: use foundational knowledge in real scenarios with guidance._

- Use `grep` with simple regex patterns to search logs or text files.
- Apply character classes to match ranges (e.g., `[0-9]`) in input streams.
- Demonstrate anchors to filter lines beginning or ending with certain text.
- Implement grouping `()` and alternation `|` in `grep -E` or `egrep`.
- Perform simple substitutions with `sed` using regex patterns.
- Illustrate the difference between `grep -E` (extended) and `grep -F` (fixed).
- Execute regex searches within `awk` using the `~` operator.
- Use quantifiers (`*`, `+`, `?`) to capture repeated patterns.
- Apply escaping to handle special characters (e.g., `\.` to match a literal dot).
- Demonstrate combining multiple regex concepts in one search expression.

---

### Level 3 ‚Äì Building

_Focus: deliver projects independently and solve real problems._

- Construct regex patterns to validate structured input (emails, IPs, dates).
- Develop complex search filters for log files using pipelines with `grep`, `awk`, `sed`.
- Organize regex usage into Bash scripts for reusable text processing.
- Solve data-cleaning tasks with regex substitutions in `sed`.
- Produce regexes that capture subgroups and backreferences in `sed` and `awk`.
- Modify existing regexes to adapt to new requirements without breaking functionality.
- Design regex-based extraction tasks (e.g., extracting fields, stripping tags).
- Integrate regex with `find` or `xargs` to filter and batch-process files.
- Use `grep -o` to extract matches rather than whole lines.
- Build regexes that balance readability with precision for team scripts.

---

### Level 4 ‚Äì Advancing

_Focus: optimize, integrate, and analyze in complex environments._

- Analyze regex performance tradeoffs in large datasets (e.g., catastrophic backtracking).
- Evaluate regex readability vs. complexity for maintainability in Bash scripts.
- Integrate regex with advanced Bash workflows (`while read`, process substitution).
- Optimize pipelines by combining regex filters with other tools (`cut`, `awk`, `jq`).
- Compare BRE, ERE, and Perl-compatible regex (PCRE via `grep -P`) for feature tradeoffs.
- Adapt regex patterns for localization and encoding issues (UTF-8 vs ASCII).
- Lead debugging of regex-based scripts when patterns fail or overmatch.
- Critique existing team regexes for clarity, performance, and correctness.
- Extend regex-driven Bash scripts to integrate with enterprise ETL pipelines.

---

### Level 5 ‚Äì Innovating

_Focus: establish best practices, create new solutions, and mentor others._

- Invent enterprise-ready regex style guidelines for Bash scripting.
- Create reusable Bash regex libraries or snippets for common validation tasks.
- Propose best practices for balancing regex vs. alternative parsing tools.
- Mentor teammates on regex debugging and optimization strategies.
- Establish team standards for testing and documenting regex in scripts.
- Lead development of regex-heavy Bash utilities for log analysis or data transformation.
- Formulate new techniques to reduce regex errors in production (test suites, linters).

## ‚ö° Environment Notes

* **OS base image:** Ubuntu 22.04 (recommended)
* **Tools required:** `git` (‚â•2.34), `make`, `bash`
* **Optional tools:** `jq`, `sqlite3` (depending on fixtures)
* **Default workspace:** `./labs` (overridable with `LAB_ROOT=/path make up`)

---

## üßπ Resetting & Cleaning

* `make reset` ‚Üí Full reset (wipes and re-runs bootstrap).
* `make clean` ‚Üí Deletes the labs directory only.
* `make reup` ‚Üí Equivalent to `make clean` + `make up`.

---

## üß™ Verification

The verification script checks:

* Correct branches, commits, and tags exist.
* Repo state matches baseline (no missing fixtures).
* Optional tests run successfully (e.g., `git bisect` finds seeded bug).

Run with:

```bash
make verify
```

---

## üîí Safety

All repos and files are **local and sandboxed**.
No external network calls are made (remotes are simulated with local bare repos).

---

## üôã Help

```bash
make help
```

```

---

## Example Lab Environment (Git)

- **Fixture:** Repo with `main` and `feature` branches, 5 commits each.  
- **Bootstrap:** `git init`, add commits programmatically.  
- **Reset:** Remove repo directory and recreate from seed script.  
- **Verify:** Run `git log`, `git branch` to confirm seeded state.  
- **Size:** < 1 MB, runtime < 10s.  
- **Orchestration:** Use `make up`, `make verify`, `make reset`.  
- **Packaging:** Deliver as `git-lab-starter.zip`.
