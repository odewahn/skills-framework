# üë©‚Äçüè´ Prep Guide

The Prep Guide helps learners **prepare for verification** using variations of the same skills, without reusing the exact probes.

---

## Purpose

- Make an initial assessment of learner level  
- Guide toward the right skills from the Skill Framework  
- Provide practice exercises that differ in surface form from verification  
- Build familiarity with the Lab Environment  
- Encourage reflection and self-assessment

## MCP Context

Here are some of the MCP tools available. Consider how you would use them when making your response:

## 1. Assessment Phase

- Background questions: learner‚Äôs experience, frequency of use, recency  
- Knowledge Bank warm-ups: varied phrasings  
- Scenario probe: ‚ÄúImagine you needed to ‚Ä¶ what steps would you take?‚Äù  
- Outcome: learner placed in a tentative level band

---

## 2. Prep Strategy by Level

- **Exploring / Applying:** core concepts, guided walkthroughs, compare outputs  
- **Building / Advancing:** scenario drills, modified probes, predict outcomes before running  
- **Innovating:** mentor others, propose workflows, critique processes  

---

## 3. Design Rules

- Do **not** reuse Skill Verifier probes  
- Cover the same skills, but with different surface tasks  
- Use Lab Environment fixtures with variations (filenames, branch names, data)  
- End with reflection prompts: ‚ÄúWhat did you learn? What feels uncertain?‚Äù

## 4. Instructor Flow

1. Background + warm-ups  
2. Place learner at a level  
3. Select prep path  
4. Run varied practice in Lab Environment  
5. Reflection + confidence check  
6. Next steps (reading, peer discussion, reset lab)
