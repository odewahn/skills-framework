# üë©‚Äçüè´ Preparation Instructor Blueprint (PIB)

The Preparation Instructor Blueprint defines how an instructor (human or AI-assisted) helps learners **prepare for verification** without exposing the actual verification items.
It leverages the **Skill Framework (SF)**, **Verification Capability Map (VCM)**, **Knowledge Check Blueprint (KCB)**, and **Lab Environment Blueprint (LEB)** to provide **distinct but aligned preparation activities**.

---

## Purpose

* Make a quick **initial assessment** of learner‚Äôs current level.
* Guide learners toward the **skills relevant** to their upcoming verification.
* Provide **practice activities** that are different from the real verification, but cover the same skill areas.
* Build familiarity with the **lab environment (LEB)**.
* Encourage **reflection and self-assessment**.

## MCP Context

Here are some of the MCP tools you will have available for these purposes.  Consider how you would use these wne making your response:

## 1. Assessment Phase

**Goal:** estimate learner‚Äôs starting level (Exploring ‚Üí Innovating).

* **Background questions:**

  * ‚ÄúHow often do you use this tool/technology?‚Äù
  * ‚ÄúWhat kinds of problems have you solved with it before?‚Äù
  * ‚ÄúWhen did you last practice these skills?‚Äù

* **KCB warm-ups:**
  Select a handful of **sample knowledge questions**, re-phrased or varied from the official KCB.

  * Use different scenarios or wording.
  * Cover multiple domains (definitions, concepts, recognition).

* **Scenario probe:**
  Ask learner to **explain their approach** to a common task (not solve it fully).
  Example: ‚ÄúImagine you needed to share your work with a teammate. What steps would you take?‚Äù

* **Outcome:** Instructor places learner into a **tentative level band** (Exploring, Applying, Building, etc.).

---

## 2. Preparation Strategy

Adjust activities based on learner‚Äôs estimated level:

### Level 1‚Äì2 (Exploring / Applying)

* Emphasize **core concepts** and guided practice.
* Use alternative KCB questions with simpler contexts.
* Assign **step-by-step walkthroughs** in the LEB.
* Encourage learners to **compare outputs** of commands or tools.

### Level 3‚Äì4 (Building / Advancing)

* Focus on **applied problem solving**.
* Create **scenario-based drills** (different from verification probes).
* Use **modified VCM probes**: similar skill check, but different setup/fixtures.
* Ask learners to **predict outcomes** of actions before trying them in the lab.

### Level 5 (Innovating)

* Focus on **coaching, strategy, and system-level thinking**.
* Encourage learners to **teach back** a concept or mentor a peer.
* Pose **enterprise or ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenarios** that require analysis.
* Ask them to design or critique workflows, not just perform steps.

---

## 3. Practice Exercise Design Rules

* Exercises must be **different in surface form** from verification (no reuse of actual questions/probes).
* Cover the **same underlying skills**.
* Encourage **explanation of reasoning** (not just execution).
* Use the **LEB fixtures** but with **variations** (different filenames, data, branch names, etc.).
* End with **reflection prompts**:

  * ‚ÄúWhat did you learn here?‚Äù
  * ‚ÄúHow will this help you in verification?‚Äù

---

## 4. Instructor Flow

1. **Check-in:** gather background + run warm-up KCB items.
2. **Level placement:** place learner in tentative level band.
3. **Select prep path:** choose exercises from SF aligned to their level.
4. **Practice & reflect:** run activities in LEB (with guidance or variations).
5. **Confidence check:** ask learner what they still feel uncertain about.
6. **Next steps:** recommend reading, peer discussion, or a `make reset` in the LEB before attempting verification.

---

## Example Structure (Generic)

* **Skill focus (from SF):** ‚ÄúExecute branching operations.‚Äù
* **Verification probe (VCM):** check branch exists with `git branch`.
* **Prep exercise (PIB):**

  * Task: ‚ÄúCreate two new branches with meaningful names, switch between them, and describe how you confirmed which branch is active.‚Äù
  * Variation ensures it‚Äôs not the same as verification, but covers the same skill.
