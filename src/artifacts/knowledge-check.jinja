# üìù Knowledge Check Blueprint (KCB)

The Knowledge Check Blueprint (KCB) is a companion to the **Verification Capability Map (VCM)**.
Where the VCM handles lab-based or manual verification, the KCB is focused on **knowledge checks** ‚Äî multiple-choice or short-answer questions designed to verify **Level 1 (Exploring)** skills, and occasionally simple recall items in higher levels.

Its purpose is to:

* Provide a structured bank of questions aligned directly to skills in the framework.
* Support multiple question types (MCQ, True/False, Short Answer).
* Document correct answers, distractors, and hints for remediation.
* Ensure that knowledge checks can be delivered consistently and reused across labs, quizzes, or courses.
